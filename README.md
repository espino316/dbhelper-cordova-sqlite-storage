Helper for the great plugin Cordova-sqlite-storage

This is a helper for plugin Cordova-sqlite-storage (https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage).

The goal is make more simple the use of the plugin (already excellent), because I like to use shorter more maintainable code.

**Important** In order to use this component, you must first install Cordova-sqlite-storage (https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage).
